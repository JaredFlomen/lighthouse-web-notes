### Day 2: Lighthouse Notes

* We had the first lecture today. It really helped clarify some functions, including process.argv which takes input from the user and can be manipulated.
* I needed some clarificaiton on an assignemnt, asked for help, and got the guidance. I was then able to complete all of today's work.
* Today was a good day of coding. I felt better prepared for the day, and I'm looking forward to what's next.
