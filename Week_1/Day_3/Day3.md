### Day 3 at Lighthouse Labs

* Our morning lecture involved Objects in JavaScript
* We learn't how valuable Objects are, including how order doesn't matter
* The work today invloved counting items in an array and outputting that to an object.
* As of this push, I'm working on finalizing the work that's due today
