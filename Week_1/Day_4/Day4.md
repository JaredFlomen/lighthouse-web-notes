### Day 4 at Lighthouse Labs

* Today's morning lecture was about callbacks
* A callback is a loop that iterates over every element in an array
* We also learnt about conditional and named callbacks

#### A small victory

* With help from a mentor, we were able to solve a big problem I was having yesterday. The code wouldn't exectue as I hoped, and after some time it did. Woo!
