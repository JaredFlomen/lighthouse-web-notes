### Day 5 at Lighthouse Labs

* Today started off with our first practice test. I was able to complete every exercise, just finishing after the time ran out. 
* That was a great way to start off the day.
* I got help from a mentor, which clarified a few things in the music library exercise. That clarity will come in handy during future tasks.
