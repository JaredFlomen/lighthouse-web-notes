### Day 6 at Lighthouse Labs

* This morning's lecture focused on Test Driven Development
* We went deeper into Mocha and Chai 
* For example, we went over some examples using deepEqual to compare arrays
* Upon completion of today's work, our lotide clone project was complete - a group of funcitons I worked to build since Day 1 of bootcamp. While it's not being formally graded, which was disappointing, I still felt satisfaction completing the project.
