### Day 7 at Lighthouse Labs

* This morning's lecture focused on Asynchronous Javascript.
* We learnt about some repetitive functions including serTimeout and serInterval.
* We also got an introduction to Filesystem functions and reading files.
* Today's pair programming exercise went well - we managed to complete the work before time ran out and it outputted as expected.
