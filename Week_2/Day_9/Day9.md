### Day 9 at Lighthouse Labs

* Today's lecture revolved around Promises
* We also dove into callbacks, which take in functions as a paramter.
* We went through an example of 'callback hell' and how promises can make the code more streamlined.
* The exercises today were tough, and I will need extra review to master the topic.
